We learn by doing, not viewing. The Learning Design of @pythonfab is based on learning science principles. 



The concepts in each unit will be presented in short explanatory videos. Each video will be approximately 7-10 minutes.

Each unit will be accompanied by chapter from the textbook "Python for Absolute Beginners".

The concepts in each unit will be reinforced by "pre" practice exercises.

Meetup sessions will be live interactive sessions, not lectures. You will be expected to have watched the video, read the chapter, and worked on the practice exercises.

After the Meetup, you will be assigned additional "post" practice exercises to evaluate your understanding of the unit. You may also request "recitation sessions" if you need more feedback.


Learning complex skills is inherently a team activity. Collaborative coding challenges will be presented during the course. They are intended to develop complex problem solving skills in a group setting. The collaborative coding challenges are optional.
