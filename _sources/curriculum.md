- **Unit 0: Orientation:** In the orientation session we will go over the curriculum and expectations. There is also a brief introduction to the main concepts of programming. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 1: Getting Started:** In Unit 1 we will introduce the programming environment and the tools you will be using during the course of study. You will also write your a few elementary programs.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 2: Simple Data Types and Operations.** In Unit 2 we introduce Python simple data types and operations. We can think of the simple data types as the atoms of the language. Everything that follows builds on the simples.



<p>&nbsp;</p>



- **Unit 3: String Methods.** In Unit 3 we study a variety of string methods. Strings are sequences of characters. In the unit we will introduce concepts that are also critical to the study of collections. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 4: Collections and Operations.** In Unit 4 we study the principal collections in Python: *lists*, *tuples*, *sets*, and *dictionaries*. In Level I we will work mostly with lists and tuples. We will work systematically with sets and dictionaries in Level II.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 5: Iteration.** In Unit 5 we introduce Iteration with the use of *for* and *while* loops. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 6: Branching.** In Unit 6 we study various techniques for branching through statements, such as if .. else. 


<p>&nbsp;</p>


- **Unit 7: Functions.** In Unit 7 we introduce Python functions.  In your study of Python, you will be writing your own functions but also accessing the rich array of functions in the Python standard and extended libraries.
